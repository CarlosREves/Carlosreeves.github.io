        <h1>How to bake a cake!</h1>
        <p>STEP 1
            Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.
        <p>STEP 2
            In a large bowl, beat together 200g golden caster sugar, 200g softened unsalted butter, 4 large eggs, 200g self-raising flour, 2 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder, ½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tbsp milk and a pinch of salt until pale.</p>   
            <p>STEP 3
            Divide the mixture between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</p>  
        <p>STEP 4
            Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>  
        <p>STEP 5
            For the buttercream, put 100g chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.</p>  
        <p>STEP 6
            Mash 200g softened butter and 400g icing sugar together with a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.</p>  
        <p>STEP 7
            Sift in 5 tbsp cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour in the melted chocolate and 2 tbsp milk. Mix again until smooth.</p>  
        <p>STEP 8
            On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of the buttercream, then spread the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.</p>  
        <p>STEP 9
            To make chocolate shards: melt 50g dark chocolate and pour it onto a tray lined with baking parchment or foil.</p>  
        <p>STEP 10
            Now melt 25g milk chocolate and 25g white chocolate and drizzle them over the dark chocolate before it sets.</p>  
        <p>STEP 11
            Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.</p>

        <h2>Spagetti Carbanana</h2>
        
        <p>STEP 1
            Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
        </p>
        <p>   
            STEP 2
            Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
        </p>
            <p>   
            STEP 3
            Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
        </p>
            <p>    
            STEP 4
            Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
        </p> 
        <p>  
            STEP 5
            Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
        </p>
        <p>   
            STEP 6
            While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
        </p>
        <p>   
            STEP 7
            Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
        </p>
        <p>    
            STEP 8
            Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
        </p>
        <p>    
            STEP 9
            Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
        </p>
        <p>    
            STEP 10
            Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
        </p>
        <p>    
            STEP 11
            Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
        </p>
        <p>    
            STEP 12
            Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.</p>
